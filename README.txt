Before executing the program, node modules may need to be installed with:
`npm install canvas` – canvas module for all the drawing
`npm install prompt-sync` – module for user input through terminal
(missing dependencies may differ on different computers, most should be resolved with `npm install [missing module name]`)


The program can then be run using node.js using the command:
`node chibiBot.js`

=====

Creation page:
The first page to appear in the terminal is the chibi creation page. Here, some of the basic intrinsic properties of a chibi can be customized. By entering a property number and a value, the property can be customized. For certain properties, entering values out of range will set it to its max/min instead (does not work for colors). Pressing enter without any other input will advance the program to the next page, pose settings.

Seeding:
Each time the code is executed, the program begins with a brand new chibi generated by the displayed seed. Each time the program is ran, entering the seed will restore the exact same chibi.

Pose page:
This page allows for customization of the chibi's poses and accessories. The mouth style, eye style, and accessories are identified by id numbers, the full list of which is recorded at the bottom of this page. Pressing enter without any other input will create an image of the chibi and end the program. Entering '7' will advance to the animation page instead.

Animation page:
This page allows the user to select a preset animation that will use the properties of the chibi from the previous pages. Pose properties may be overridden depending on the animation chosen. The animation is output as a gif and the program ends.
